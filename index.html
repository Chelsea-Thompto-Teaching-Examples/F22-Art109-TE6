      Technical Exercise 6:
      <br />
      Intro to JavaScript
    </h1>
    <p>
      This exercise will consist of two parts. If you are using Glitch, save all
      files on your own Glitch project and export to a GitHub repository. If you
      are using Atom and Github, create a new repository for this excerise that
      contains all required files.

    <h2>
      Part 1:
    </h2>
    <p>
      Read
      <a

        href="https://eloquentjavascript.net/02_program_structure.html"
        >Chapter 2</a
      >
      of the <i>Eloquent JavaScript</i> book and complete the exercises at the
      bottom. The exercises are repeated below. For each exercise, write a new
      script (as it's own .js file) that completes the task and save each.
      <br /><br />
      <strong>NOTE:</strong>
      <br />
      When using Atom, you can use atom-live-server and a basic HTML page to run your scripts locally for testing.

    <h3>
      Exercises
    </h3>
    <h4>
      Looping Triangle
    </h4>
    <p>
      Write a loop that makes seven calls to console.log to output the following
      triangle:
    </p>
    <pre>
#
##
###
####
#####
######
#######
    </pre>
    <h4>
      FizzBuzz
    </h4>
    <p>
      Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to
      100, with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead
      of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz"
      instead.
      <br /><br />
      When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz" for
      numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still print "Fizz" or
      "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those).
    </p>
    <h4>
      Chessboard
    </h4>
    <p>
      Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8Ã—8 grid, using
      newline characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there
      is either a space or a "#" character. The characters should form a
      chessboard.
      <br /><br />
      Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:
      <br />
    </p>
    <pre>
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
    </pre>
    <p>
      When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a binding size
      = 8 and change the program so that it works for any size, outputting a
      grid of the given width and height.
      <br /><br />
      <strong
        >You will have 3 scripts (each their own .js file) in total at the end
        of Part 1.</strong
      >
    </p>
    <h2>
      Part 2:
    </h2>
    <p>
      In order to begin exploring how JavaScript interacts with HTML, you will
      create a new simple HTML page. On the page, use at least one h1 tag, one p
      tag and one button. Add a script to the page that generates an alert
      window when you click the button.
      <br /><br />
      The alert documentation can be found

      and adding a script within and HTML document is explained

      <strong
        >You will have an HTML file plus the 3 previous scripts at the end of

    <h2>
      Submission:
    </h2>
    <p>
      You should have 3 JS files and 1 HTML file with embedded JS at the end of
      this exercise. All 4 files should be housed in a single GitHub
      repository.<br /><br />
